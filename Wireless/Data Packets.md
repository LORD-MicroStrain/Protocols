int8_t nodeRssi;								//Node RSSI
int8_t baseRssi;								//Base Station RSSI
uint16_t checksum;								//Checksum of [stopFlag - chData]
```

#####Notes:
**Sample Mode:**

 * 0x01 - Burst Mode
 * 0x02 - Continuous Mode

**Timestamp / Tick:**
Although each packet may contain more than one sweep per channel, there is only one timestamp and tick acquired per packet. Therefore the tick and timestamp values must be incremented manually for each sweep in the packet. This can be done via the following:

* Using the sample rate of the node, determine your increment value:
  * If sample rate is 32 Hz, the increment is 0.03125. (1 / 32)
  * If sample rate is 1 per 2 seconds, the increment is 2.
  * Multiply the increment by 1,000,000,000 to convert to nanoseconds.
* For each sweep in the packet, add the calculated value to the original timestamp.
* For each sweep, increment the tick by 1.

**Channel Data:**
Multiple sweeps of data per channel may be contained in one packet. The number of sweeps in the packet can be determined via the following:

* bytesBeforeData = 14
* bytesPerSample = 2 for uint16 or 4 for uint32 or float data.
* numSweeps = ((payloadLen â€“ bytesBeforeData) / numActiveChannels) / bytesPerSample)

Channel data should be parsed in the following manner:

- Sweep 1, First active channel
- Sweep 1, Next active channel (Repeat for each active channel)
- Sweep 2, First active channel
- Sweep 2, Next active channel (Repeat for each active channel)
- Repeat for each Sweep in the packet 

## Diagnostic Packet
```cpp
uint8_t startByte 					= 0xAA;		//Start of Packet Byte
uint8_t stopFlag 					= 0x07;		//Delivery Stop Flag
uint8_t appDataType 				= 0x11;		//App Data Type
uint16_t nodeAddress;							//Node Address
uint8_t payloadLen;								//Payload Length
uint8_t packetInterval;							//Packet Interval
uint16_t tick;									//Tick
uint8_t info1Len;								//Info Item 1 Length
uint8_t info1Id;								//Info Item 1 ID
uint8_t | uint16_t | uint32_t info1Val;			//Info Item 1 Value
//Repeat Info Item Length, ID, and Value for all the Info Items in the packet
int8_t nodeRssi;								//Node RSSI
int8_t baseRssi;								//Base Station RSSI
uint16_t checksum;								//Checksum of [stopFlag - infoXVal]
```

#####Notes:
**Diagnostic Packet Interval:**
The interval of which the Diagnostic Packet is transmitted. The 2 most significant bits of this byte signify the interval type (seconds, minutes, or hours). The remaining 6 bits are the interval value. The interval types are as follows (shows in binary):

* 00 = Seconds
* 01 = Minutes
* 10 = Hours

Example (in binary):
0110 1011 = 43 minutes  -> *first 01 represents minutes, 10 1011 represents the value 43.*

**Tick:**
The Tick represents a counter for the Diagnostic Packet, signifying how many of these packets have been sent. When this value reaches the max 2-byte value (0xFFFF), it will roll over to 0.

**Info Items:**
An Info Item consists of Length, ID, and Value bytes. Each Info Item can be parsed by first looking at the length byte to determine how many bytes make up the rest of the rest of the Info Item (ID and Value). The Info Item ID can then be compared against the table below to determine how to parse the value bytes that follow. Multiple Info Items can be in one packet. Use the payload length to determine the number of Info Items in the packet.

**Info Item Length:**
The length (# of bytes) of the Info Item, including the Info Item ID and Info Item Value bytes. This length
value does not include the Info Item Length byte itself. 

**Info Item ID / Value:**
The Info Item ID represents the type of information that is given in the next Info Item Value bytes. The following are the supported IDs:

ID  | Description   | Data Values | # Bytes | Type | Unit 
----|---------------|----------------|----------|-------|------
0x01| Transmit Info | Total Transmissions <br> Total Retransmissions <br> Total Dropped Packets | 4 <br> 4 <br> 2 | uint32 <br> uint32 <br> uint16  | counts <br> counts <br> counts
0x02 | Active Running Time | - | 4 | uint32 | seconds
0x03 | Battery Life Remaining | - | 1 | uint8 | percent


* **(0x01) Transmit Info**
	* **Total Transmissions** - # of unique packets transmitted (not including retransmissions)
	* **Total Retransmissions** - # of retransmitted packets (packets are retransmitted when a node doesn't receive an acknowledgment from the base station)
	* **Total Dropped Packets** - # of packets node has discarded due to buffer overflow or exceeding the max # of retransmissions per packet
* **(0x02) Active Running Time** - # of seconds the node has been in a sampling mode
* **(0x03) Battery Life Remaining** - % estimated battery level

*Full Example:*
If the Info Item Length byte is 0x0B, the next 11 bytes make up the Info Item ID and Value. If the next byte is 0x01, then we know the Info Item Value is signifying Transmit Info which is made up of Total Transmissions, Total Retransmissions, and Total Dropped Packets. From the table we know to parse the next 4 bytes as a uint32 representing the Total Transmissions, the next 4 bytes as a uint32 representing the Total Retransmissions, and the last 2 bytes as a uint16 representing the Total Dropped Packets.
